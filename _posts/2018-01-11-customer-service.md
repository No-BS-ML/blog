Learning the theoretical background for data science or machine learning can be a daunting experience, as it involves multiple fields of mathematics, and a long list of online resources.

####  Multivariable Calculus

```html
Determinant in space: det( -> B, A, -> C -> )
Triangle in space with vertices P = (1, 0, 0), Q = (0, 1, 0), R = (0, 0, 2), find angle at P:
PQ PR
cos θ = 1 , θ ≈ 71.5◦. |
−−→ PR | √2
√5 √ PQ || 10
```
